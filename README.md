# Hey, I'm Windokk, a beginner game designer/developper !

I love video games, computer science and art. I mostly code in c++, c and python but i also did some MC mods in java (Forge).

I do a lot of projects in Unreal Engine 4 & 5 (in c++ or blueprints) but i also tried Unity (C#) and pygame.

## Projects i'm working onto right now 👨‍💻

- Organ-16 💾 : A simple 16 bit CPU architecture
- Epoch 🕰️ : My dream game engine
- https://windokk.dev 🌐 : My personal portfolio website

## Projects I worked on in the past

- Spark Engine (my first game engine, please don't look at it, it's horrible)
- Magnet Engine 🧲 : A wannabe 3D/2D game engine written in C++ using Vulkan (discontinued)
- Magnet Launcher ⛏️ : A Minecraft Java launcher (functionnal but full of bugs + missing features)

## Projects I will work/rework on

- An IDE
- Fenix 🐦 : My personal OS (x86_64) (using GNU Grub 2)
