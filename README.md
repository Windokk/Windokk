# Hey, I'm Windokk, a french game developper 🇫🇷 !

I love video game, computer science and art in general. I mostly code in c++ and python but i also do some MC mods in java (Forge).

I do a lot of projects in Unreal Engine 4 & 5 (in c++ or blueprints) but i also tried unity and pygame.

## Projects i'm working onto right now 👨‍💻

- Spark Engine ⚙️ : A 3D game engine coded in C++ with OpenGL.
- Demo VGM 🚶 : A demo of some advanced gameplay mechanics such as complex locomotion, ai, items and inventory, and a light rpg system
- Equinox 🏝️ : A first person survival game where you're stranded on an island and you have to survive the rough nature.
